Topic – Recursion
Questions:

1. Implement a function to print all possible combinations of characters in a string.
The length range of the combinations would be [1 to string length].
For Eg: Input: GOD, Output: {G, O, D, GO, OD}.
Note: GO and OG are the same combination and only one of them should be in the output. 

2. Write recursive code to print the Fibonacci Series.
Note: The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, …
The next number is found by adding up the twonumbers before it.
Similarly, the 3 is found by adding the two numbers before it (1+2)
